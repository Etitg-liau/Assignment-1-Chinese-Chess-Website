        <h3 class="htpheader2"><b><u>Understanding the Pieces</u></b></h3>
        <div class="htptext">
            <b><h1>1. The General</h1></b>
            <img src="../Images/General.PNG">
            <p>The General is the most important piece on the board. It is like a king, where once the king is dead,<br> you <u><b>lose the game</b></u>. Similarly, the aim of the goal is to take the enemy's general down. The General<br> moves one position at a time, horizontally or vertically, but is restricted to moving within <b><u>The Palace</b></u>.<br> Black General is represented using '将' and Red General '帅' or '帥'</p>
            <b><h1>2. The Guards / Advisors</h1></b>
            <img src="../Images/Guard.PNG">
            <p>The guards can only move diagonally one position at a time, but cannot leave <b><u>The Palace</u></b>. There are<br> two advisors, one on each side of the general.<br> Advisors are represented using '仕' for red and '士' for black</p>
            <b><h1>The Palace</h1></b>
            <img src="../Images/Palace1.PNG" width="400" height = 350 class="palace1"><img src="../Images/Palace2.PNG" width="400" height = 350 class="palace2">
            <p>The Palace is a 3 x 3 box with a total of 9 positions inside.<br>As mentioned earlier, the general and two advisors cannot leave the palace.<br> The General starts in the center at the bottom of the board. The two generals <b><u>cannot face each other</u></b>,<br> i.e. no pieces in between both Generals</p>
            <b><h1>3. The Pawns</h1></b>
            <img src="../Images/Pawns.PNG">
            <p>There are 5 pawns (also known as soldiers). They can move forward one position at a time. The pawn captures by moving <br> forward into a piece. But, as you’ll see in the section on The River, when the pawn crosses the river<br> in the center of the board, the pawn can then move and capture forward or sideways, one spot at a time.<br>               
                Unlike international chess, the pawn does not get promoted to another piece when it reaches the last row.</p>
                <p>The pawns are represented using '兵' and '卒'</p>
            <b><h1> 4. The Chariot</h1></b>
            <img src="../Images/Chariot.PNG">
            <p>The chariot (or car) is the most powerful piece. The chariot can move orthogonally as far as<br> there are open positions, and he captures an opponent piece by landing on it. Chinese Chess<br> <b><u>does not have a queen</u></b>, so it is important to keep this piece alive.</p>
            <p>The chariot is represented using '车' or '車'</p>
            <b><h1>5. The Horse</h1></b>
            <img src="../Images/Horse.PNG">
            <p>The horse moves similar (but not exactly) to a knight in international chess. The horse moves two positions<br> in one direction, then continues to one in another direction. If there is a piece in the horse’s path,<br> it cannot jump over the piece. It starts to become a more valuable piece in the endgame.</p>
            <p>The horse is represented using '马' or '馬'</p>
            <b><h1>6. The Elephant</h1></b>
            <img src="../Images/Elephant.PNG">
            <p>The elephant moves diagonally exactly two positions. There cannot be a piece blocking its movement.<br>
                The elephant cannot cross The River. The elephants are often used in conjunction to protect each other<br> and the general.</p>
                <p>The elephant is represented using 象 for black and 相 for red</p>
            <b><h1>7. The Cannon</h1></b>
            <img src="../Images/Cannon.PNG">
            <p>The cannon can move as many positions as are open horizontally or vertically. It is a powerful piece,<br>
                 just slightly inferior to a chariot. It is unique as it must jump over a piece (the cannon mount)<br>
                 along its path (a piece from either army) and then land on its victim to capture a piece.</p>
            <p>The mount can be the enemies piece or your own pieces.</p>
            <p>The cannon is represented using 炮</p>

            <b><h1>The River</h1></b>
            <img src="../Images/River.PNG">
            <p>It divides the board in half, and strengthen soldiers to be able to move diagonally, and does not<br>
                allow the elephants to cross, or even pieces in The Palace.</p>
            <br><br>
            <b><h1>Setting Up The Board</h1></b>
            <img src="../Images/Setup.PNG" class="boardsetup">
            <p>Familiarize yourself with the lines on the board before placing your pieces on the board. Chinese chess pieces are<br>
                 placed on line intersections, which are called points, instead of in the actual board squares.</p>
            <p>Each piece has a designated place on the board, as in International chess. To play Chinese chess,<br> you need to make sure that your pieces are all in the correct place on the board.</p>
            <u><p>On the row nearest you, place your pieces on the points from left to right:<br></u> the chariot, horse, elephant, guard, king, guard, elephant, knight, and chariot.</p>
            <u><p>On the third row,<br></u> place your two cannons on the intersection that is one space from the edge of the right and left side of the board.</p>
            <u><p>On the fourth row,<br></u> place your soldier pieces on every other intersection, beginning with the first intersection on the edge of the board.</p>
