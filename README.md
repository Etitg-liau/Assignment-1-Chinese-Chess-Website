# ID - Assessment 1: Chinese Chess Website
Hello, Welcome to my Chinese Chess Website. I enjoyed the learning process of html, css and javascript and implemented a website from what I've learned. <br><br>

Despite there being challenges that I encountered, I am still glad of the final result produced.

# Design Process:
Well, you might be wondering where I got this idea from? I realized that the ICT society CCAs, Overflow and Nullsec, both of which I participate quite actively in, have websites about their Special Interest Groups. 
<br><br>

Being a curious person, I decided to lookup for a Chinese Chess website for Ngee Ann Poly since it was my other interest group, but to no avail. **It was then that I decided to create one to promote Ngee Ann Polytechnic Chinese Chess SIG. Of course to get people to join our Chinese Chess Club as well**. With the help of friends, lecturers and members from the club, this project was completed!
<br><br>

Well, I have 2 wireframes, one that is a draft before starting the website and the updated wireframe which encompasses everything.

You can view both under the wireframe folder
# Features
Moving On to Features, and I am excited to tell you that there are a lot of them!

1. Translating the whole website to Chinese or English when sliding top right hand corner of the page
2. An interactive Chinese Chess Board as a Menu
3. Animated welcome message
4. Signing Up Form
5. Chinese Chess Puzzles/EndGame viewer
6. Header
7. Interactive Socials<br><br>
Last but not Least,
8. A Real Live Chinese Chess game that can be played, (coded in javascript)<br><br>
Note: There are unfortunately some bugs, where you cannot end the game.
<br><br>

So therefore, features wanted to implement:<br>
- Solving the bug to the Chinese Chess game
- Question Section where users can Post their Questions on Chinese Chess for everyone to see

# Technologies Used

Javascript - Chinese Chess Gameplay<br>
HTML - main language to display content<br>
CSS - formatting to make it more appealing

# Testing
As mentioned earlier, there are some bugs in the Chinese Chess Game where you cannot end the game.<br>

Form may be able to receive nonsensical inputs :open_mouth:<br>

Recommended to view on a computer preferably 1093 x 790 px.<br>
Phone screens are supported with 370px x 720 px. (width must be 720px else [bye bye chess pieces and board])<br>
Unfortunately, some screens like tablets, larger/smaller computers are unable to display appropiately.<br>
<br>

Tried to use:<br>
- https://validator.w3.org/
- https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/<br>
But didn't understand their errors
