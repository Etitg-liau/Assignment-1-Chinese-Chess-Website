# ID - Assessment 1: Chinese Chess Website
Hello, Welcome to my Chinese Chess Website. I enjoyed the learning process of html, css and javascript and implemented a website from what I've learned. Despite there being challenges that I encountered, I am still glad of the final result produced.

# Design Process:
Well, you might be wondering where I got this idea from? I realized that the ict society CCAs, Overflow and Nullsec, both of which I participate quite actively in, have websites about their Special Interest Groups. Being a curious person, I decided to lookup for a Chinese Chess website for Ngee Ann Poly since it was my other interest group, but to no avail. It was then that I decided to create one to promote Ngee Ann Polytechnic Chinese Chess SIG. With the help of friends, lecturers and members from the club, this project was completed!

Well, I have a basic wireframe that I thought of but it is very plain and not like my current website.

# Features
Moving On to Features, and I am excited to tell you that there are a lot of them!

Feature 1: Translating the whole website to Chinese or English when sliding top right hand corner of the page
Feature 2: An interactive Chinese Chess Board as a Menu
Feature 3: Animated welcome message
Feature 4: Signing Up Form
Feature 5: Chinese Chess Puzzles/EndGame viewer
Feature 6: Header
Feature 7: Interactive Socials
Last but not Least,
Feature 8: A Real Live Chinese Chess game that can be played, (coded in javascript)
Note: There are unfortunately some bugs, where you cannot end the game.


So therefore, features wanted to implement:
Solving the bug to the Chinese Chess game
Question Section where users can Post their Questions on Chinese Chess for everyone to see

# Technologies Used

Javascript - Chinese Chess Gameplay
HTML - main language to display content
CSS - formatting to make it more appealing

# Testing
As mentioned earlier, there are some bugs in the Chinese Chess Game where you cannot end the game.

Form may be able to receive nonsensical inputs haha.

Recommended to view on a computer preferably 1920 x 1200 px.
Phone screens are supported with 360px x 720 px to 400px x 720 px .(width must be 720 else [bye bye chess pieces])
Unfortunately, some screens like tablets, larger/smaller computers are unable to display appropiately.

Tried to use:
https://validator.w3.org/
https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/
But didn't understand their errors
